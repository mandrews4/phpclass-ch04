Q What are the four primary arithmetic operators?
A: + => addition
   - => subtraction
   * => multipication
   / => division

Q Why will the following code not work:

    print "The total is $$total";

A In php, $$VARIABLE represents a variable variable. It
  must be managed in a special manner when used in a
  php print statement.

Q What must be done instead?
A The first dollar sign can be escaped with a backslash

    print "The total is \$$total";

Q Why must an HTML page that contains a form thatâ€™s being
  submitted to a PHP script be loaded through a URL?
A So that the php-language constructs of the php page are
  parsed and executed by the php module of a web server

Q What functions can be used to format numerical values? How
  do you format numbers to a specific number of decimals?
A The "round()" and "number_format()" functions can be used
  to format floating point numbers to a specific number of
  decimal points.

  Both arguments support an argument which specifies the
  number of decimal points to round to.

Q What is the importance of operator precedence?
A Operator precedence specifies the order in which arithmetic
  expressions are evaluated.

  For example, in the following expression:

    8 + 4 / 2

  the operator precedence rules state that the division
  operator has higher precedence that the addition operator.

Q What are the incremental and decremental operators?
A The incremental and decremental operators are the ++ or
  -- operators, which when specified after a php numeric
  variable, add one or subtract one from the value held by
  the variable:

  For example:

  $a++; is equivalent to "$a = $a + 1";
  $a--; is equivalent to "$a = $a - 1";

Q What are the arithmetic assignment operators?
A The arithmetic assigment operators are short forms of longer
  assignment statements.

  For example:

  $a *= 10; is equivalent to $a = $a * 10;
  $a += 5; is equivalent to $a = $a +5;
